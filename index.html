      <h3> History of F1 üëáüèª</h3>
  <ol>
      <p id="dot"> The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. 
      The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon after World 
      War II during 1946, with the first non-championship races being held that year. The first one, the first Formula 1 race ever,
      was the Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war, but 
      due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship was not formalised until 1947. The first world 
      championship race was held at Silverstone, United Kingdom in 1950. A championship for constructors followed in 1958. National championships 
      existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held for many years, but due to the increasing 
      cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983. On 26 November 2017, Formula One unveiled its new logo, following the 2017 season finale in
      Abu Dhabi during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit. The new logo replaced F1's iconic 'flying one', which had been the sport's trademark 
      since 1993. </p>

      <dt class="pic"> Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) of the FIA,
      forerunner of FISA, as the premier single seater racing category in worldwide motorsport to become 
      effective in 1947. This new "International Formula" was initially known variously as Formula A, Formula
      I, or Formula 1 with the corresponding "Voiturette" formula being titled Formula B, Formula II, or Formula
      2.[1] When the 500c formula was internationally recognised as Formula 3 in 1950 it was never titled as 
      "Formula C" so the three International Formulae were then "officially" titled Formula 1, Formula 2 and 
      Formula 3.[2]In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II regulations defined by 
      engine capacity. The regulation expected to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated 
      cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-litre 
      supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war supercharged 3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned. The first race 
      under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, the race being won by Achille
      Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.Championships for drivers or constructors were not introduced immediately. 
      In the early years there were around 20 races held from late Spring to early Autumn (Fall) in Europe, 
      although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly
      Alfa Romeo. Races saw pre-war heroes like Rudolf Caracciola, Manfred Von Brauchitsch and Tazio Nuvolari 
      end their careers, while drivers like Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio rose to the front.</dt>
     
      <h4> The era of factory Italian and Mercedes front-engine cars (1950‚Äì1957) </h4>
      <p> The Motorcycle World Championships was introduced in 1949. In 1950, the FIA responded with the first 
      ever official World Championship for Drivers. The championship series, to be held across six of the 'major' 
      Grands Prix of Europe plus the Indianapolis 500, was in effect a formalization of what had already been 
      developing in Grand Prix racing during the previous years. Italian teams of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati
      were best positioned to dominate the early years. Other national manufacturers ‚Äì such as the French manufacturer 
      Talbot or the British BRM ‚Äì competed, although less successfully. A number of private cars also took part in local
      races. The Italian and German factory teams in those days often employed 2 to 3 drivers whose nationality was 
      the same as the team's and at least 1 foreign driver; for example the Alfa Romeo team in 1950 consisted of Italian
      drivers Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Piero Taruffi; and Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio.
      Alfa Romeo dominated all before them in the 1950 season, winning every race bar one in the championship with the 
      pre-war "Alfetta" 158s. The sole exception was the Indianapolis 500, which was part of the championship, although 
      not run to Formula One regulations and rarely contested by the European teams. The race would never be important for
      Formula One and was no longer part of the championship after 1960.</p>

      <p>Nino Farina won the inaugural championship, Juan 
      Manuel Fangio taking it in 1951 with the Alfa-Romeo 159, an evolution of the 158. The Alfetta's engines were extremely
      powerful for their capacity: In 1951 the 159 engine was producing around 420 bhp (310 kW) but this was at the price 
      of a fuel consumption of 125 to 175 litres per 100 km (2.26 to 1.61 mpg imp/1.88 mpg to 1.34 mpg US).[3] Enzo Ferrari,
      who had raced the Alfettas before the war, and his engine designer Aurelio Lampredi, were the first to understand 
      that the 1.5-litre supercharged engine was a dead end: Any increase in power meant more fuel to carry or more time 
      lost in the pits for refuelling, For the last races of 1950 Ferrari sent his 1.5-litre supercharged 125s to the
      museum, and fielded the new V12 4.5-litre normally aspirated 375s. With a fuel consumption of around 35 litres per 
      100 kilometres (8.1 mpg‚Äëimp; 6.7 mpg‚ÄëUS) the 375s offered fierce opposition to the Alfettas towards the end of the 
      1951 season. Alfa Romeo, a state-owned company, decided to withdraw after a refusal of the Italian government to 
      fund the expensive design of a new car. Surprisingly, Alfa Romeo involvement in racing was made with a very thin 
      budget, using mostly pre-war technology and material during the two seasons. For instance the team won two 
      championships using only nine pre-war built engine blocks.
      No Alfa Romeo, a supporting cast of privateer Lago-Talbot entries and an almost undriveable, unreliable BRM would make Ferrari 
      would last until 1954 before switching to 2.5-litre atmospheric engines. Major manufacturers were already working to develop cars 
      for the future regulation and it was obvious that nobody would develop a new car for only two years. The promoters of the World Championship
      Grands Prix, mindful of the lack of serious competition for the Alfettas, eventually all adopted Formula Two regulations for two years. 
      However, Ferrari's dominance went on with the light 4-cylinder powered 500s, bringing Italian Alberto Ascari his two championships in 
      the 1952 and 1953 seasons. Ferrari's Formula One cars continued to race very successfully in non-Championship Formula One and Formule 
      Libre races through this period. Ironically, during this period the only World Championship race for which Formula One cars were eligible 
      was the Indianapolis 500. In 1952 Ferrari entered four Formula One 375s with Alberto Ascari as lead driver, but with little success.
      Discounting the Indianapolis 500, the World Championship was entirely based in Europe until 1953 when the season opened in Argentina. Since
      then there has always been at least one race outside Europe.</p>

       As planned, the World Championship races returned to Formula One regulations for the 1954 season, now based on a new 2.5-litre atmospheric
      engine regulation. This successfully brought more entrants to the field. Lancia and Mercedes-Benz came to the formula, hiring the
      best drivers of the era: Ascari for Lancia, Fangio for Mercedes. Featuring desmodromic valves, fuel injection, magnesium and exotic 
      alloys parts, "streamlined" bodywork and other advanced features, the brand new Mercedes began the 1954 season with Fangio taking pole
      position at the "Grand Prix de l'ACF" at Reims-Gueux with the first lap over 200 km/h (124 mph) in Formula One before winning the race 
      after a duel with other Mercedes driver Karl Kling, who finished second.
      The Mercedes cars swept the next two seasons with Fangio winning all but three of the races. However, at the end of the 1955 season Mercedes 
      vanished as swiftly as they had come. They had proven the superiority of their technology, but the crash of one of their sportscars that 
      year at Le Mans, killing 83 people, was also a significant factor. The company would not return to Formula One for forty years.[4] After 
      Le Mans, four of the year's remaining Grands Prix were cancelled.
      The Monaco Grand Prix saw a spectacular incident when Ascari and his Lancia crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. Ascari 
      was pulled out of the water alive and apparently well. However, there was speculation over an undetected internal injury when four
      days later Ascari was killed at Monza while testing a sportscar. After Ascari's death, Lancia followed Mercedes out of the category,
      passing their engines, cars, information and technology to Ferrari.
      The 1956 season saw Fangio make good use of the Lancia-born Ferrari to win his fourth championship. Driving for Maserati, he took his fifth 
      championship in the 1957 season, a record which would not be beaten for 46 years.
      Ferrari developed a new engine for 1957, the V6 "Dino" engine, it was competitive by 1958 and Mike Hawthorn became the first British F1 
      World Champion, though his victory was short-lived, he died the following winter.</p>
